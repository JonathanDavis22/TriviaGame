A Javascript-based trivia game. Featured on one dynamic page, click 'Start the game' to have the gamedisplay appear in the container. Questions with radiobutton answers populate the display. Select your answer choices, then hit submit at the end. You are timed, so be swift.

Methods such as setInterval, hide, display, append, and other functions are written to provide a quiz which is timed and, based on an object of question/answer arrays, graded against the correct choice of each question/answer array.
